# Data Analysis Notes
## Notes on XML 

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language

__XML__ was designed to **carry data** - with focus on what data is  

HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks  

XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are 

XML is just information wrapped in tags
